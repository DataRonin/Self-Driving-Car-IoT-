# Self-Driving-Car-IoT

- This code is part of the lab work for Hands-on Internet of Things Specialization by Matthew Caesar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
- I did the online version of the four-part course/ specialization. As part of the course, the idea is to build a self-driving, 4 WD car (kit) that is based on a Raspberyy pi 4.
- We built the following things as part of the coursework:
-- Bluetooth and Web-based control
