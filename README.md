# Self-Driving-Car-IoT

- This code is part of the lab work for Hands-on Internet of Things Specialization by Matthew Caesar at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
- One of the best things I ever did, with my free time. It involves a lot of sensors, decent amount of programming and theory and the hands-on part is just awesome. Highly recommend it for anyone interested!
- I did the online version of the four-part course/ specialization. As part of the course, the idea is to build a self-driving, 4 WD car (kit) that is based on a Raspberyy pi 4. 
- (Hardware: https://www.sunfounder.com/products/raspberry-pi-car-robot-kit-4wd)
- We built the following things as part of the coursework:
    * Environment Scanning/Mapping (SLAM), using the Ultrasonic sensor onboard.
    * Obstacle Avoidance, using along with the sensor data, the Pi-cam footage (object detection).
    * Bluetooth communications - for software dev and troubleshooting.
    * Creating a Web-based controller (frontend) and controlling the car within the network!
    * Firewalling, Packet Inspection, Wireless Configuration, wireless configuration.
    * Case Study: The Uber Cloud Backend
